                     data is compiled from pesticide use reports with data at the daily time-step (required
                     by growers in CA). Pesticide concentrations are predicted using mechanistic models that
                     consider climate, hydrology, irrigation practices, and pesticide properties in the 226 
                     watersheds within ~100 km of the Bay Delta Watershed (22,000 km2). 13% of Californiaâ€™s

                     1) Which activities are imposing the greatest pesticide loads? 
                     2) Who is responsible?
